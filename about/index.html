   <h2>The Edgington Lectures</h2>
   <p>
    The Edgingtons are a biennial pair of lectures held in the
    <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/philosophy/">Department of Philosophy</a>
    of <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/">Birkbeck College</a>,
    University of London.  The lectures are free to
    attend and open to all, and each pair is accompanied by a graduate workshop
    in philosophy devoted to, and led by, the work of that year's Edgington
    lecturer. The lectures are named in honour of Professor Dorothy Edgington.
