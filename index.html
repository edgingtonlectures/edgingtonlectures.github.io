   <h2>The Lectures</h2>
   <h3>What Trustworthy People Do</h3>
   <p>
    Trustworthy people are honest and well-meaning, but that's not the whole
    story.  We often slide into untrustworthiness by over-estimating our
    capacities, or by under-estimating the challenges we face.  So knowledge of
    our selves and knowledge of our circumstances are crucial requirements for
    trustworthiness.  The lectures will explore how trustworthy people
    deliberate about potential new commitments.  And they will emphasise that
    tough circumstances make it more difficult to achieve trustworthiness, no
    matter how honest and well-meaning a person may be.
   </p>
   <h2>When and Where</h2>
   <p>
    Fri. 8th June,<br />
    Sat. 9th June,<br />
    Birkbeck College, University of London.

   <h2>Graduate Workshop</h2>
   <p>
    In tandem with the Edgington Lectures, Professor Hawley will lead a graduate
    workshop, which graduate students in philosophy and related disciplines are
    invited to attend.  This will run on both days of the
    lectures.
   </p>
   <p>
